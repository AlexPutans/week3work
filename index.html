            My symbol is a magpie bird, because I can write the Russian name in English letters - COPOKA.</p>

        <p>I like everything mystical, mysterious and magical. I dream to meet aliens and talk with them about our life

        <p>I study programming at the CodeYourFuture school, it is very interesting and informative, and most
            importantly - it is free.<br>
